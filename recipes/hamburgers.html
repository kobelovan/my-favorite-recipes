    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For 2 hamburgers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz ground beef</li>
        <li>kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 slices cheese, such as swiss, cheddar, or american, optional</li>
        <li> 2 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>topping of your choice, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the beef into 2 patties, each about ¾-inch (2 cm) thick and 3 ½ inches (9 cm) in diameter.</li>
        <li>Transfer the patties to a plate or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the patties from the fridge and season on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil to the pan and swirl to evenly coat. Place
            the patties in the skillet and cook, undisturbed, on the first side for 5 minutes, until a brown crust
            forms.</li>
        <li>Flip the patties, top each with a slice of cheese (optional), and cook, undisturbed, until the patties are
            browned on the other side, the cheese is melted, and the meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes more for
            medium-well doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove the patties from the pan and transfer to a clean cutting board. Let rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the burger patties on buns and serve with your favorite toppings and sauces.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
